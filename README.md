<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

> ## Description
&emsp;&emsp;This project began at 21-12-2022, while beta-testing was from 16-03-2022 till .Intended to design a complete collection of useful resources mainly for the Electrical Engineering students, any person can be benefited from it. This is a collaborative platform where any user can upload the study material, while the admins can either delete it or modify it as per need.<br />
The backend is deployed on [cyclic.sh](https://www.cyclic.sh/) at [
https://average-satti-backend.cyclic.app](
https://average-satti-backend.cyclic.app), while [Drive API](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/guides/about-sdk) is used for the files to be uploaded and deleted. JSON Web Token ([JWT](https://jwt.io/)) are used for the authentication purposes.
> ## Getting started
 1. Firstly clone the repository into your local machine.
 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/Krishna-D-K/Project-Frontend
```
 2. cd to cloned folder and install the dependencies using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) .
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```
3. Run the frontend in the cloned folder using the command.
```bash
npm run start
```
4. If you have access to the backend repository used for this project, and wish to run the server on your localhost, change the [Apiservice](https://github.com/Krishna-D-K/Project-Frontend/blob/main/src/Apiservice.js) file to your local port number of server. For example: 
```
const Apiservice = "http://localhost:<PORT_NUMBER>";
export default Apiservice;
``` 
5. If you wish to access the backend repository of the project, drop an email at [iwannabeflash@gmail.com]() specifying the purpose.
